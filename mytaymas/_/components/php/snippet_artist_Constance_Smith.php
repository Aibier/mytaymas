		<p>Constance received the Fullerton-Brighton-Norwell Award for Modern Art for her mixed-media image of a tree of life, with jewel-adorned branches depicting the arms of humanity, and precious gemstone-decorated leaves representing the spouting buds of togetherness. The daughter of a New York jeweler, Constance has been salvaging the discarded remnants of her father's jewelry-making since she was five years old, and won the New York State Fair grand prize at the age of 8 years old for a gem-adorned painting of the Manhattan Bridge.</p>
		<p>Constance has been commissioned to "paint" the altar of a historic church in Wicklow, Ireland with gemstones that belonged to several prominent Irish families. She will depart for Ireland shortly after the CAC and plans to complete the work over a course of 4 to 6 months. Join Constance on Thursday for her session on " The Art of Salvaging" where she'll give insight into collecting and finding salvageable "junk" and turning it into beautiful art.</p>
