		<p>Art is Richard's third career. He is a Vietnam veteran who proudly served his country for 15 years after the war. As an adult, Richard returned to college to pursue a degree in Architecture, and was a practicing and award-winning architect for another 30 years. His architectural designs awakened within him a deep longing for painting and drawing, and he began slowly by painting incredibly unique renditions of his successful architectural structures. Seeing peoples' response to his paintings, brought an excitement that Richard had never known, and upon retiring, Richard enrolled in the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design to learn all he could about painting.</p>
		<p>In three short years, Richard jump-started his career as one of the most talented street portrait artists in New York City, unearthing a hidden talent that he never knew was within him. Now, as a seasoned portrait artist at the age of 72, and the oldest graduate of Roux Academy, Richard loves to share his success story and remind people that it's never too late to follow your heart. Richard will be a featured lecturer on Wednesday, when he discusses his "38 Faces" collection.</p>
