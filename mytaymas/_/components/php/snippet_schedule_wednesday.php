			<h3>The Un-Collection</h3>
			<h4>Elizabeth Hall</h4>
			<p>Barot Bellingham's new collection is pieced together from seemingly unrelated individual works of varying topic. From portraits to landscapes to abstract, Barot does it all, and does it all well. The only unifying factor is the excellence in form, technique, color, and balance that exudes from each and every individual work in The Un-Collection. Meet Barot, and his undeniably original collection of art, and be forever enchanted.</p>

			<h3>Beyond the Naked Eye</h3>
			<h4>Dennison Hall</h4>
			<p>Get a glimpse at the rare offerings in Xhou's exhibit, ranging from an exquisite skyscraper painted on a grain of rice, to a miniature sculpture of an oak tree filled with detailed animals, the size of a thimble. Items are shown on a large screen, using Xhou's patented rear-projection device that magnifies the image to reveal incredible detail. Beyond the Naked Eye is a fantastic exhibit that blends art and science in a most magical way.</p>
