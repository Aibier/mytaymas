			<h3>The Use and Absence of Color in Modern Art</h3>
			<h4>Elizabeth Hall</h4>
			<p>Hassum Harrod is a "color specialist," in every sense of the phrase. His inherent ability to create color palettes that illuminate an image and allure an audience, has drawn praise from traditionalists as well as modern artists - no small feat in today's diverse art world. His master's thesis at San Francisco Art Academy is entitled "Color Upon Color – The Mixing and Reinventing of Color." It is this thesis that prompted Hillford & Bilken to publish his solo-authored book on color, that will be used in undergraduate art programs throughout the world starting next year.</p>
			<p>His session at CAC will be an offshoot of his new book and is expected to be standing-room only. So, grab a seat and be prepared for a lesson on color that you'll never forget.</p>

			<h3>The Art of Salvaging</h3>
			<h4>Victoria Hall</h4>
			<p>Never was the phrase "one person's trash is another person's treasure" more accurate than when discussing Constance Olivia Smith's art methodology. While some of her creations are built using fine gemstones, the majority of her work relies upon the discards of a wasteful planet. From bottlecaps to paper scraps to mechanical parts – there is seemingly no refuse that hasn't been used in an original scrap art painting by Olivia. And while there are an increasing number of scrap artists in existence, none have the level of achievement that is so frequently observed in Olivia's creations.</p>
			<p>In the Art of Salvaging, Olivia will share her talent for finding and selecting scrap materials, as well as the philosophy behind several of her more celebrated works of art. If you're interested in recycling and mixed media, this session will include a lively discussion of both, from the woman who Art International Digest calls the "foremost queen of scrap art."</p>

			<h3>The Art of Abstract</h3>
			<h4>Dennison Hall</h4>
			<p>The leader of the MMA artistic movement in his hometown of Portland, Riley Rudolph Rewington draws a crowd wherever he goes. Mixing street performance, video, music, and traditional art, Riley has created some of the most unique and deeply poignant abstract works of his generation. Join Riley in Dennison Hall for an intimate discussion on The Art of Abstract, in which he shares his philosophies about modern abstract art, and critiques some of this own work – with complete candor and a healthy dose of personality.</p>
