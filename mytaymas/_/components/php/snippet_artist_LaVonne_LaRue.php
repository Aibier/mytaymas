		<p>LaVonne's giant-sized paintings all around Chicago tell the story of love, nature, and conservation - themes that are central to her heart. LaVonne's love affair with mural and graffiti paintings began when she was just a child and rode the train into Harlem with her parents to visit her grandfather. Along the route, she would focus on the graffiti art, sometimes being amazed at its beauty and sometimes exclaiming that it was a terrible waste of a building canvas.</p> 
		<p>She knew that once she was old enough she would begin to create art along train and bus routes in inner cities to provide everyone with a chance to glimpse the rare beauty of phenomenal graffiti murals.</p>
		<p>Even after moving with her family from New York to Chicago in her early teens, her dream stayed alive, and she was the first person ever to be paid to paint a mural on the Reynold's Sky Tower â€“ at the early age of 16. LaVonne will share her love and skill of graffiti art on Monday's schedule, as she starts the painting of a 20-foot high wall in the Rousseau Room of Hotel Contempo in front of a standing-room only audience in Art in Unexpected Places.</p>
