		<p>Art is in Gerard's genes. His father, Maston Gerard Donahue was a sculptor who helped create some of the most notable statues of our time, including the "Windmill of Time" in Washington, D.C. His mother Lillian Paxton Donahue, is a landscape painter who supported the family full-time by the sale of her paintings, after the untimely death of Gerard's father when Gerard was just 13. Gerard learned the early lessons in sculpting from his father, and continues to study sculpture as his life's passion, partially to complete the legacy of his father, and partially to forge this own destiny as an accomplished sculptor. He is currently the Renton Scholar at Deschton University in Vienna Austria, and is completing his artist in residence commitment for the next year.</p>
		<p>Gerard has paved a unique path as a sculptor in that he works with untraditional sculpting materials including natural tar, precious gems, and ice. He has created ice sculptures that are displayed behind glass, under permanent refrigeration, in several museums, as well as in private homes. Gerard will give an ice sculpture demonstration at the Fountain of Intrigue on Tuesday's conference schedule.</p>
